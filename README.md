# Dealing with a Tangled Mess of Financial Entries

Walk with me.

## 1. Promote First Row to Headers

I started by promoting the first row to headers using the **Use First Row as Headers** option under the **Transform** tab. This helped give the dataset proper column titles.

## 2. Remove Blank Rows

Next, I removed all the blank rows to clean things up. I did this by going to **Remove Rows** and selecting **Remove Blank Rows**.

## 3. Understand the Hierarchy via Indentation

Looking closer, I noticed the structure of the data relied on indentation. Leading spaces showed hierarchy:

- No indent â†’ **Account Type** (e.g., *Income Statement*)
- Single indent â†’ **Category** (e.g., *Revenue*)
- Deepest indent â†’ **Subcategory** (e.g., *Stores*)

## 4. Mark Hierarchical Levels

To make that structure clearer, I replaced leading spaces with visible markers:

- `/` for Category
- `*` for Subcategory

This gave me a consistent pattern for parsing the structure later.

## 5. Extract Category and Subcategory

Using the **Extract** function under **Add Column**, I pulled text after `/` to get the Category and after `*` to get the Subcategory.

## 6. Identify Account Type

I added a conditional column:

- If the row starts with `/` or `*`, return **blank**
- Otherwise, return the original value â†’ which gave me "Income Statement", "Balance Sheet", etc.

## 7. Fill Down Contextual Columns

To assign each line item its correct context, I filled down the `Account Type` and `Category` columns. But first, I replaced empty strings with nulls to make the fill-down work properly.

## 8. Filter for Line Items Only

I filtered out rows without Subcategories. These werenâ€™t useful for my analysis, so I unchecked blanks in the `Subcategory` column.

## 9. Final Cleanup

Finally, I cleaned the dataset by:

- Moving `Account Type`, `Category`, and `Subcategory` to the front
- Deleting the original unstructured column

Result: a tidy, hierarchical dataset ready for analysis.

## ðŸ§¼ Done

Tangled mess turned into structured clarity.
